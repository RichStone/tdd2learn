# TDD to learn JS

This project tries to help you to understand the basics of programming using TDD since the very begging.

## How to run the code
To run the test cases just one time
```
npm test
```
To run in watch mode that creates a test environment for instant feedback
```
npm run test:watch
```

## What do you need to run the code
You only need to be sure you have [node (get the LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your machine

## What is JestJS
[JestJS](https://jestjs.io/) was initially created on facebook to help run test cases and now is an open source project who has helped to go beyond [Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) in the JS ecosystem
